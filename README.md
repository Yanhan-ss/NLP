# NLP

In the machine-translation file, we explore the decoding strategies for a small, pretrained NL to EN translation model. 

In the second file, we perform an NLP task of morphological processing and syntactic parsing.

In the question-answering file, we fine-tune a transformer model for the task of question answering.

In the sequence classification file, we explore neural network architectures for sequence classification; specifically, we look at a number of neural network architectures for sentiment analysis on an English dataset of movie reviews.
